# RedCat

RedCat Systems coding challenge.

Instructions:
1. Start at homepage (/).
2. Cick the link to upload a file. The sample file (/files/example.csv) can be used to upload and test.
3. After file upload, go the the data view.
4. Once columns are added, choose between the original data or the altered data with additional columns.

TODOs:
1. Add JS validation to forms.
2. Make it pretty.
3. Catch more edge cases.

This is an over-enginieered but fun app to view and manipulate CSV data. Enjoy!
